# ZnPc-TaZnPc-Simulations


This project includes model Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations aimed at evaluating the interactions of Phthalocyanines with DPPC and DPPC/cholesterol lipid bilayers.

The notebooks are located in the `Analisis` folder and have been adapted for use in **Google Colab** (tagged as `Colab-OK`). These notebooks were originally built to read `.tpr` and `.xtc` simulation files, which are available in a Zenodo repository.

Additionally, two simplified versions of the notebooks, tagged `GitHub-OK`, use sample `.csv` data files to demonstrate the workflow without requiring simulation data.

All files used in the project:

**"Insights into the interaction of Zinc-Phthalocyanines with lipid bilayers for liposomal formulation"**

are available at the following Zenodo repository:
